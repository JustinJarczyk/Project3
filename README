uthreads assignment
----------------

Enclosed to this package is the source code of the uthreads library, as a
requirement for the csc343/443 assignment. To compile it type 'make', and to
run it type './test' for a thorough test of the library implementation.

Implementation
--------------

All the required API functions, according to the assignment specification, were
implemented. Describing the implementation of each function would be redundant
as the code is self-explanatory, short, and easy to understand.

A best effort was made to implement the API according to the POSIX pthreads
specification.

You can find all functions that you need to implement by searching for "NOT_YET_IMPLEMENTED"
